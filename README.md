In this repo, I experiment with TensorFlow models and make some adaptations to them.
Keeping them as a personal library of useful models; however, I do not claim ownership of the original code.

### Models
- Multi-class CNN Text Classification
    - Original code: https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf
    - Allow to use word2vec embeddings
    - Modified the model to be multi-class
- SCLSTM Semantically Conditioned LSTM for Language Generation
    - Added method for iterative evaluations
- Sequence Tagging with Bi-RNN
