In this repo, I experiment with TensorFlow models and make some adaptations to them.
Keeping them as a personal library of useful models; however, I do not claim ownership of the original code.

### Models
- Multi-class CNN Text Classification
    - Allowed to use word2vec embeddings
    - Modified the model to be multi-class
- SCLSTM Semantically Conditioned LSTM for Language Generation
    - Added method for iterative evaluations
- Sequence Tagging with Bi-RNN
    - TODO: split training data into real train/test/dev
    - TODO: need to add training data
