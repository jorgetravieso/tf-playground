In this repo, I experiment with TensorFlow models and make some adaptations to them.

### Models
- Seq2Seq Learning
  - Original code: https://github.com/suriyadeepan/easy_seq2seq
  - Adapting it to other domains and tasks, such as keeping the conversations context
- Multi-class CNN Text Classification
  - Original code: https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf
  - Allow to use word2vec embeddings
  - Modified the model to be multi-class
- RNNLG (Aka. SCLSTM) Natural Language Generation with NN
  - Added method for iterative evaluations

### To-Do
- Try to do a spelling and grammar correction seq2seq
